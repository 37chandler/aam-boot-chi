# Chi-Square Bootstraps

In this assignment we explore the creation of t 
chi-square statistic we're familiar with from previous statistical
classes. We'll build the statistic by hand and use bootstrap
standard errors to estimate variability. 

When you submit your work, make sure to "knit" your RMD to an `.html` file and include that file in the repo you submit. (You can also knit to PDF and Word formats, which are great, but the HTML files are a bit easier for me to evaluate.)
